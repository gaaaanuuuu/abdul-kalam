    <p>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was one of India’s most respected scientists and leaders. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, to a humble family, he rose through determination and hard work to become a key figure in India’s space and defense programs.

He worked with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), where he played a major role in developing India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earning him the title “Missile Man of India.”

In 2002, he became the 11th President of India, known as the “People’s President” for his simplicity, kindness, and connection with the youth. After completing his presidency, he dedicated his life to teaching and inspiring students, promoting the vision of a strong, developed, and self-reliant India.

Dr. Kalam was also a prolific writer, with famous books like Wings of Fire, Ignited Minds, and India 2020, which continue to motivate millions. He passed away on 27 July 2015, while delivering a lecture to students — living and dying as a teacher.</p>
